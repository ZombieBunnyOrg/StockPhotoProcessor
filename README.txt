This script will:

    Use Google Vision to:
        - Identify images with faces and logos that it will skip loading to stock photo sites
        - Identify metadata that it will add to the photo before uploading the file

    Upload the Images to Adobe Stock and ShutterStock via FTP with the added metadata


To Use:
Create a config.json based on the sample on Github

Refer to SmugMug, ShutterStock, Adobe Stock and Google Vision to gather the required API, OAUTH and Json values to populate the config file
